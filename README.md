# virtual-voucher
When I was doing my remote internship I discovered a problem I wanted to solve when it came to the company I worked for providing food for remote Engineers. I was thinking I could build a Virtual Food Web Application that allows event organizers to give virtual food vouchers to attendees so that they can redeem them at eateries and fast food joints around them.  This is targeted to the world of remote work, virtual events, meetings and parties happening around the world and creates a way for attendees to get refreshed at local restaurants or eateries around them using a virtually generated voucher the owner of the event or meeting assigned. 

so yeah, i did it.
